                            > Putting my stylesheet under the new theme stylesheet
                            > Adding !important after background-image: url(imgs/PhotoFunia-1763751617.jpg);
                            >changing img location after moved to file 
                                >new location = "../imgs/PhotoFunia-1763751617.jpg"
    
    New Code : 
        *stylesheetindex
        body,html{
            height: 100%;
            }

            .bg {
            background-image: url("../imgs/PhotoFunia-1763751617.jpg") !important;
            height: 100%;
            background-position: center;
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            background-size: cover;
            }
        *index.html
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="CSS/Bootstrap.css">
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="CSS/stylesheetindex.css">

        prompt -> hi im trying to use a bootstrap.css theme file and my own css file for a web page this is what my
         css file looks like. how do i keep that photo background with the bootstrap theme 
         body,html{ height: 100% } 
         .bg { background-image: url(imgs/PhotoFunia-1763751617.jpg); 
         height: 100%; background-position: center; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: cover; }

         Followed by prompting it why it wasnt working leading to the img solution from the folder move.
