            <link rel="stylesheet" href="CSS/Bootstrap.css">
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="CSS/stylesheetindex.css">

        prompt -> hi im trying to use a bootstrap.css theme file and my own css file for a web page this is what my
         css file looks like. how do i keep that photo background with the bootstrap theme 
         body,html{ height: 100% } 
         .bg { background-image: url(imgs/PhotoFunia-1763751617.jpg); 
         height: 100%; background-position: center; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: cover; }

         Followed by prompting it why it wasnt working leading to the img solution from the folder move.

#3 Had trouble researching how to get data from a database to display in html as text for a webpage. Used Chat GPT to Show and explain how with
a fake trees database. Here is the examples

    *Index.js
        const express = require("express");
        const sqlite3 = require("sqlite3").verbose();
        const app = express();
        const port = 3000;

        // Allow frontend to access files
        app.use(express.static("."));

        // Open DB
        const db = new sqlite3.Database("./trees.db");

        // API route
        app.get("/tbltrees/:id", (req, res) => {
            const id = req.params.id;

            db.get("SELECT * FROM tbltrees WHERE TreeID = ?", [id], (err, row) => {
                if (err) return res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
                if (!row) return res.status(404).json({ error: "Tree not found" });

                res.json(row);
            });
        });

        app.listen(port, () => {
            console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
        });

                    // Select container
                    const container = document.getElementById("tree-info");

                    // Populate container
                    container.innerHTML = `

                    `;
                }

                loadTree();
            </script>

    prompt -> It took quite a bit of prompting to finally get it to give me a working project and some research on my end.
                this result helped me figure out what i need to research. 


#4 Used chatGPT to take a mysql database script from our created database in dbdiagram (a database creation software) and reformat it in a 
 way that I (Beth) could use to quickly make our needed tables using a sqlite extenstion

#5 Asked chatGPT to clear up how to use multiple node.js files and how i Should structure that inside a project.
                    
#6 Can you have  the following while loop make it so for every animal, it creates a new card in a html file?
for refrnce, here is the while loop: while (animalNum > 0) { //print out card console.log("this is an animal") //window.location.replace("testhtml.html")
//decrase animalnum by a integer
animalNum -= 1



}
and this is the span for a new card in html: <span class="position-absolute top-50 start-50 translate-middle"> <div class="card" style="width: 10rem;"> <div class="card-header bg-dark text-white text-center">Animal Name</div>
        <img src="https://placebear.com/g/150/150" class="card-img-center" alt="animal photo"></img>

        <div class="card-body d-flex justify-content-center bg-warning">
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-warning"><a href="imgs/cow.png">COW FARM</a></button>
        </div>

    </div>
</span>

Got it 👍 — right now your while loop just logs text, but you want it to actually inject cards into your HTML file dynamically. To do that, you’ll need to manipulate the DOM instead of using console.log.
Here’s a clean example that takes your loop and appends a new card for each animal:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Animal Cards</title>
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Container where cards will be added -->
  <div id="card-container" class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center"></div>

  <script>
    let animalNum = 5; // number of animals
    let animals = [
      { name: "Bear", img: "https://placebear.com/g/150/150", link: "imgs/bear.png" },
      { name: "Cow", img: "imgs/cow.png", link: "imgs/cow.png" },
      { name: "Dog", img: "https://place-puppy.com/150x150", link: "imgs/dog.png" },
      { name: "Cat", img: "https://placekitten.com/150/150", link: "imgs/cat.png" },
      { name: "Horse", img: "imgs/horse.png", link: "imgs/horse.png" }
    ];

    let container = document.getElementById("card-container");

    let i = 0;
    while (animalNum > 0) {
      let animal = animals[i];

      // Create card element
      let card = document.createElement("span");
      card.className = "position-relative m-3"; // spacing between cards
      card.innerHTML = `
        <div class="card" style="width: 10rem;">
          <div class="card-header bg-dark text-white text-center">${animal.name}</div>
          <img src="${animal.img}" class="card-img-center" alt="animal photo">
          <div class="card-body d-flex justify-content-center bg-warning">
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-warning">
              <a href="${animal.link}" class="text-dark text-decoration-none">${animal.name.toUpperCase()} FARM</a>
            </button>
          </div>
        </div>
      `;

      // Append card to container
      container.appendChild(card);

      // Decrease counter
      animalNum -= 1;
      i++;
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>

🔑 Key points:
- Instead of console.log, use document.createElement and innerHTML to build the card.
- Append each card to a container (#card-container).
- Use an array of animals so each card can have unique data (name, image, link).
- The while loop decreases animalNum until it hits zero, creating one card per iteration.
👉 This way, when you open the HTML file in a browser, you’ll see multiple cards generated dynamically.
Would you like me to also show you how to replace the while loop with a cleaner forEach loop over the animals array? It’s often more readable and avoids manual counters.

Miguel: have it so that when the  "New Animal" button is pressed in animalhome.html, newanimal.js creates a new card that has fillable entries in the html webpage.

GitHub Copilot: I'll create a short todo plan, then update animalhome.html to add button IDs and a container, and replace newanimal.js with code that creates fillable cards and handlers. I'll apply both file edits now.

Created 3 todos

Now I'll apply the code changes to animalhome.html and newanimal.js. This will add IDs, a container, and a working script for fillable cards.

Marking the plan steps complete and recording progress.

Completed: *Add IDs and container* (1/3)

Done — changes applied.

What I changed
- **animalhome.html**: added `id="btnNewAnimal"` and `id="btnFilter"` to the buttons and added a container `div` with `id="animalCardsContainer"` to host dynamic cards.
- **newanimal.js**: replaced the old/placeholder script with a script that:
  - Creates a new card with editable inputs when #btnNewAnimal is clicked.
  - Lets the user enter Name, Image URL, Species, DOB, Sex.
  - Supports Save (converts inputs to a read-only card), Cancel (removes the card), Edit (re-open inputs), and Delete.
  - Uses Bootstrap classes so the card appears styled consistently.

How to test locally
- Open animalhome.html in your browser (double-click or serve the folder).
- Click the New Animal button.
- Fill the fields and click Save — the card will convert to read-only with Edit/Delete options.
- Click Edit to modify fields; click Delete to remove the card.

Notes and next steps
- Current implementation is purely client-side and ephemeral (no persistence). If you want data saved to a backend or to localStorage, I can add that.
- The Filter button is left as a placeholder; tell me how you want filtering to work (by species, sex, etc.) and I’ll implement it.
- If you'd prefer a modal-based form (SweetAlert2 or Bootstrap modal) instead of inline cards, I can switch to that.

Would you like me to:
- Add persistence (localStorage or a simple backend)?
- Implement filtering UI and logic?
- Convert the form to a modal instead?

Miguel: Have Filtering work as checkmarks that determine the order in which an animal is ordered alphabetically, by name, species, sex, or date of birth.

GitHub Copilot: I'll add a filter panel to animalhome.html and update newanimal.js to store card data attributes and implement sorting based on selected checkboxes and direction. I'll apply patches to both files now.

```


Starting: *Test instructions* (3/3)

Progress update: I added a filter panel in animalhome.html and implemented sorting logic in newanimal.js. Next I'll describe how to test and what I changed in detail.

What I changed
- animalhome.html
  - Added `id="animalCardsContainer"` (already added earlier).
  - Added a filter panel (`id="filterPanel"`) containing checkboxes for: `Name`, `Species`, `Sex`, `Date of Birth`, a `Direction` select (Ascending/Descending), and `Apply`/`Clear` buttons.
- newanimal.js
  - Cards now store their data on the element via `dataset` when saved: `data-name`, `data-species`, `data-dob`, `data-sex`, `data-img`.
  - The `Filter` button toggles the filter panel visibility.
  - `Apply` reads which checkboxes are checked in the fixed priority order (Name, Species, Sex, DOB) and sorts the cards accordingly. If multiple fields are checked, they form the sort tie-breaker sequence. Direction (asc/desc) is applied to the whole comparison.
  - `Clear` resets the checkboxes to a sensible default (Name + Species checked, others unchecked) and applies sorting.
  - Sorting comparison uses case-insensitive localeCompare for text and numeric comparison for DOB (dates).

How sorting priority works
- The filter panel checkboxes determine which fields are included in sorting.
- The priority order is fixed: Name → Species → Sex → DOB. The sort uses the first checked field in that order as primary key, second checked as secondary, etc.
  - Example: If you check Name and DOB, items are sorted by Name; when Names tie, they are sorted by DOB.
- Direction (Ascending/Descending) applies to all comparison levels.

How to test locally
1. Open animalhome.html in a browser (double-click or serve the folder).
2. Click `New Animal`.
3. Fill Name, Species, DOB, Sex and optional Image URL, then click `Save`.
4. Create several cards with different values (at least 3-5).
5. Click `Filter` to open the filter panel.
6. Toggle checkboxes and choose direction, then click `Apply`. Cards should reorder according to checked fields and direction.
7. Use `Clear` to reset filters.

If you'd like
- Change the priority to be user-controlled (drag-to-order) instead of the fixed order.
- Persist cards to `localStorage` so they remain after refresh.
- Use a modal form instead of inline edit cards.

Which would you like next?
